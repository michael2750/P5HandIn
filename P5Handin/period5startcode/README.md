### This is almost were we ended in the class

Please note the changes I have added to prevent importing the store more than once.


## If you did not attend the class

This project includes a simple json-server backend which will let you get started without the Node/Express/Mongo-part

You need to install the json-server first so do: ```npm install -g json-server```  before you start (this will use the file books.json, as its data-store, if you start it a explained below).

- Now (after having cloned this project), open a terminal in the root of the project and type: ```npm run backend```. Open a Browser with the URL: http://localhost:7777/books to see this server in action
- Open another terminal, also in the root of the project, and type ```npm start``` to see test the React-client we did in the class, using this backend.
